      "Here's an approach to this problem using a mix of Greedy and Dynamic Programming methods. The main idea is to minimize the travel distance while ensuring that all required products are picked up.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Approach:**\n",
      "1. **Initialization and Input Parsing:** First, parse the input to extract the number of products (N), the number of shelves (M), the quantity matrix \\(Q\\), the distance matrix \\(d\\), and the required products \\(q\\).\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Greedy Selection of Shelves:** \n",
      "   - **Required Shelves:** Identify shelves that have at least one product that needs to be picked up.\n",
      "   - **Build Distance Map:** You need both the distances between shelves and the initial and final distances to/from the door (point 0).\n",
      "   - **Heuristic Based Selection:** A simplified nearest neighbor heuristic can be applied to construct an initial feasible route. This heuristic iterates through visiting the closest shelf that meets the required criteria.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Optimize Route:** Once an initial route is constructed, further optimization algorithms like 2-opt or dynamic programming (if feasible under constraints) can be applied to minimize the travel distance.\n",
